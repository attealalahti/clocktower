# Clocktower In Person App
App for running games of Blood on the Clocktower in person. Inspired by the terrific [Townsquare](https://github.com/bra1n/townsquare) tool. Using this app, the Storyteller can manage the game and send character tokens to players' devices.

## Blood on the Clocktower
[Blood on the Clocktower](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/) is a social deduction game created by the Pandemonium Institute. This is a free unofficial application for running the game in person. This project is not affiliated with the Pandemonium Institute. Consider [buying the official grimoire](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/pages/buy) to support the creators.

## How to play
All players except for the Storyteller join the game on their phone browsers. They enter their names which become visible for the Storyteller on the /storyteller page. Currently only one game can be hosted at a time. The Storyteller picks characters for the players and sends them to their devices when they are ready. After that, the game plays like it does normally with the physical edition, except that the Storyteller's Grimoire is managed with the app and all players can view the other possible roles in the game on the /cheatsheet page.
